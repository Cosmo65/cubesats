# Link Budget

## 2.1. Main formulas

### 2.1.1. Expected Signal-to-Noise ratio

Before we start considering even different types of modulation it is extremely valuable to know what SNR values can be expected on the receiver side. In fact, we can calculate the SNR as:

$$
SNR  = P_t  + G_t + G_r + \eta_{t} + \eta_{r} - L_r - L_t - L_{add} - L - N  \qquad (1.1)
$$

where $$N$$ is the total termal noise power \(relates to the noise spectral density $$N_0=kT_{noise}$$ and double-sided white noise variance $$\sigma^2=\frac{N_0}{2}$$\) in dBm, $$P_t$$ is the transmitted power in dBm, $$G_t$$ and $$G_r$$ are the antenna gains  on the transmitter and receiver sides respectively \(in dBi\), $$\eta_{t}$$ и $$\eta_{r}$$ are feeder gains in dB, $$L_t$$ and $$L_r$$ are the feeder losses in dB, $$L$$ is the path losses in dB, $$L_{add}$$ is additional losses \(some margin\) in dB.

### 2.1.2. Path loss

Path losses can be estimated by Friis formula:

$$
L = 20lg\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}[dB] \qquad (1.2)
$$

where $$\lambda$$ \(relates to the carrier frequency $$f_0=\frac{c}{λ}$$, $$c$$ is the speed of the electromagnetic wave\) is the wave length and $$d$$ is the distance between satellite and the ground station.

### 2.1.3. Noise power

Noise power can be calculated by:

$$
N = 10lg\left(\frac{kT_{noise}B_{noise}}{10^{-3}}\right) [dBm] \qquad (1.4)
$$

where $$k$$ is the Boltzmann constant, $$T_{noise}$$ is the equivalent noise temperature and $$B_{noise}$$ is the noise bandwidth. According to \[1, p.98\] the noise bandwidth $$B_{noise}$$ can be estimated roughly as $$\gamma B$$, where $$B$$ is the receiver bandwidth and $$\gamma$$ is the constant from 1.002 to 1.57 that relates to configuration of receiver.

Equivalent noise temperature is not the physical temperature of an antenna. It is equal to the temperature of a resistor, which would have the same thermal noise power in the given frequency band. This parameter can be represented as:

$$
T_{noise} = T_a+T_e \qquad (1.5)
$$

where $$T_a$$ is the sum of antenna losses and sky noise and $$T_e$$ is the receiver noise temperature. Additionally, receiver noise temperature can be calculated by following formula:

$$
T_e=T_0(F_{sys}−1) \qquad (1.6)
$$

where $$T_0$$ is equal to $$290K$$ and $$F_{sys} = 10^{\frac{NF}{10}}$$ is the noise factor which can be estimated by noise figure \($$NF$$\) of receive antenna.

### 2.1.4. Additional losses

According to \[1, p.88-96\] additional losses include:

* loss due to refraction and inaccuracy of antenna pointing \(Antenna Beam Loss\);
* phase effects in the atmosphere;
* loss due to inconsistency of polarization of antennas;
* attenuations due to hydrometeors.

**Loss due to refraction and inaccuracy of antenna pointing** depends on characteristics of the certain antenna:

$$
L_b = 10log_{10}(1+ (2\theta/\theta_{0.5})^2) \qquad (1.7)
$$

where $$ \theta$$ is the beamwidth and $$\theta_{0.5}$$ is the halfpowered beamwidth \(fig. 2.1\).

 

![Fig. 2.1 Antenna gain pattern  \[2\]](.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

According to [\[2\]](http://www.atlantarf.com/Downloads.php) total antenna losses for large cassegrain antennas are equal to 1.65 dB.

**Phase effects in the atmosphere** influence data rate, due to receiver bandwidth should be desirably selected according to table 2.1 \[1, p. 91\] to avoid phase distortions.

Table 2.1 Maximum receiver bandwidths for different ranges.

| Carrier frequency, GHz | 0.5 | 1 | 5 | 10 |
| --- | --- |
| Receiver bandwidth \(B\), MHz | 10 | 25 | 270 | 750 |

Additionaly, to avoid Faradey effect for ranges less 10 GHz only circular polarization should be used \[1, p. 91\].

**Loss due to inconsistency of polarization of antennas** can be estimated by figure 2.2 \($$e_1$$ and $$e_2$$ are coefficients of elipticity\).



![Fig. 2.2. Dependence of losses due to inconsistency of the polarizations of the transmitting and receiving antennas from the polarity elepticity. \[1, p. 93\]](.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

In general, this parameter is kind of reference data, e.g. in the link budget calculation for [NanoCom AX100](https://gomspace.com/UserFiles/Subsystems/datasheet/gs-ds-nanocom-ax100-33.pdf) polarization losses are equal to 3 dB \(and athmospheric losses are 2.1 dB,  ionospheric losses are 0.4 dB\).

**Attenuations due to hydrometeors and other additional losses** can be evaluated by [\[10\]](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/p/R-REC-P.676-11-201609-I!!PDF-E.pdf). Fortunately, for ranges smaller than 10 GHz the losses are smaller than 1 dB \(fig. 2.3 and 2.4\).

### 2.1.4. Summary

Let us provide some parameters summary:

1. **Initial point:** carrier frequency,  hight of the orbit;
2. **Equipment dependent parameters \(ajustable\)**: transmitted power , receiver bandwidth ;
3. **Reference data:** antenna gains and losses, feeder gains and losses , ****noise temperature,  additional losses.

## 2.2. Considered equipment

In fact, we use common example of ground station such as IC-910H [\[3\] ](http://sicom.ru/catalog/radiostancii/lyubitelskie/bazovye/icom-ic-9100.html)or ISIS ground station[ \[4\] ](https://www.cubesatshop.com/product/full-ground-station-kit-vhfuhfs-band/)however we can estimate some parameter of mobile stations of real space communication systems also. Fortunately, a lot of this information is open and available on official sites [\[5\]](https://www.iridium.com%20), [\[6\],](https://www.globalstar.com) [\[7\]](http://www.gonets.ru/rus/%20).

These parameters can be used for calculation of up-link link budget.

For down-link estimation real example of CubeSat transceivers such as NanoCom AX100 [\[8\]](https://gomspace.com/Shop/subsystems/communication/nanocom-ant2000.aspx) \(fig. 2.6\) may be used. Additionally, as an example of CubeSat UHF/VHF antenna omnidirectional NanoCom ANT430 \(fig. 2.5\) can be considered [\[9\]](https://gomspace.com/Shop/subsystems/communication/nanocom-ant430.aspx).

![Fig. 2.5: NanoCom AX100 by GomSpace company.](.gitbook/assets/antenna1.png)

![Fig. 2.6: NanoCom ANT430 by GomSpace company.](.gitbook/assets/transceiver.png)

For lager possible bandwidth 2.4GHz range also should be considered. For this range patch-antenna NanoCom ANT2000 and S-band transceiver NanoCom SR2000 are available[ \[10\]](https://gomspace.com/Shop/subsystems/communication/nanocom-sr2000.aspx) \(fig. 2.7\). For low speed transmission \(for example, for signaling\) UHF/VHF NanoCom ANT430 [\[11\]](https://gomspace.com/Shop/subsystems/communication/nanocom-ax100.aspx) \(fig. 2.8\) can be used.

## 2.4 Results

Results for distance between satellite and ground station that was fixed in value that is equal to height of the orbit $$h$$ are shown in the tables 2.2-2.4 of the following pdf-file:

[Click here ](https://yadi.sk/i/SuZLOYhV3Qoy6o)

![](https://github.com/kirlf/cubesats/tree/4904a8c7c26549dc8a1a08a45237d264e5cc9806/assets/8.png)  More precise calculation of the distances in dependance of elevation angles $$\phi$$ can be provided according to [\[12\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7506756/) for orbit geometries that are shown in fig. 2.8 and 2.9:

$$
d = \sqrt{(R_E+h)^2-R^2cos^2\phi} - R_Esin\phi \qquad (1.8)
$$

 where __$$R_E$$ is the Earth radius.

![Fig. 2.9.  Schematic description of a CubeSat trajectory in low Earth orbit \[12\].](.gitbook/assets/cubetrraj.png)

  
For orbit's altitude 750 km results are shown in fig. 2.10.

![Fig. 2.10. Distance between CubeSat and ground station in dependance of elevation angles \(h = 750 km\).](.gitbook/assets/distance.png)

For different LEO altitudes results are shown in fig. 2.11.

![Fig. 2.11: Distances between CubeSat and ground station in dependance of elevation angles.](.gitbook/assets/distance2.png)

Morover, if we assume that we consider environment without any influence of the atmosphere. Then circular velosity can be calculated via the classical way \(fig. 2.12\):

$$
v = \sqrt{G\frac{M}{R}} \qquad (1.9)
$$

 where $$G=6.67 \times 10^{-11} m^3 \times kg^{-1} \times s^{-2}$$  is the Gravity constant, $$M = 6\times 10^{24} kg$$  is the Earth mass and $$R = R_E + h$$  is the orbit radius \(Earth radius plus orbit heigh\).

![Figure 2.12. Cercular velosity of LEO satellites in dependance of the orbit heigh.](.gitbook/assets/velosity.png)

As we see in the Figure 2.6 Doppler shifts for 2.4 GHz may be significant and therefore mitigation of the time selective fading techniques should be included in the final CubeSat configuration.

Based on knowledge about circular velocity and heigh of the orbit visibility time can be calculated. For trajectory that is shown in fig. 2.8 and 2.9 this can be done via [\[12\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7506756/):

$$
t=\frac{2(R_E+h)arccos(\frac{R_E}{R_E+h})}{v}
\qquad (1.10)
$$

Results are shown in fig. 2.13.

More representive form of values is shown in table 2.2
