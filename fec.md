## Modulation

### Why QPSK is preferable in comparison with BPSK?

### QPSK vs. OQPSK

### QPSK vs. MSK

| Modulation | QPSK | MSK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy gain |  |  |
| Spectral efficiency | 1 | 0.667 |

### MSK vs. GMSK

### Shaped OQPSK vs. conventional OQPSK

### Shaped OQPS vs. MSK/GMSK
