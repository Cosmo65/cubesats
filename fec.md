We can make the following summary analyzing the considered matherials:

1. *S-band* includes both some of the "old" modulation schemes such as **PCM/FM**, **FSK** and **GMSK** and some of the modern schemes such as **M-APSK** (depends on a vendor's design mostly);

2. The most popular class of the modulation schemes are **M-PSK** (BPSK, QPSK, OQPSK) for both *S-* and *X-bands*.

3. One of the popular options of FEC is RSC \(Reed-Solomon convolutional\) concatenated codes. This relates to the [deep-space communication standartd](https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-63/63H.PDF).

4. Only DVB-S2/S2X standard (**{Q,8,16A,32A}PSK**) is presented for the *Ka-band*;


## 3.2. Small suggestions about modulation schemes

###  Why did M-PSK replace M-FSK?

Higher order frequency modulation schemes are not usually used in satellite communications due to their relatively low spectral efficiency and difficulties with coherent detection.

**Tab. 3.2. Spectral efficient values \(bit/s/Hz\) for different modulation orders \[1\].** 

| **Modulation scheme / Modulation order** | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| M-PSK | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 |
| M-FSK | 1 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.3125 | 0.1875 |

### Why is BPSK one of the popular solutions?
 
Although QPSK has two twice as larger throughput \(2 bits per symbol\) and the same BER \(Bit-error ratio\) performance in AWGN \(Additive White Gaussian Noise\) channel, but, practically, BPSK is more robust due to its simplicity.

### Why is OQPSK used more than QPSK?

QPSK has possible phase jumps (zero crossings). When the signal is low-pass filtered (as is typical in a transmitter), these phase-shifts result in large amplitude fluctuations. One solution to avoid π radians phase jumps, is to use Offset QPSK \(OQPSK\).

![ Signal constellations of the conventional QPSK and OQPSK.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirlf/cubesats/master/.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

>*Fig. 3.2. Signal constellations of the conventional QPSK and OQPSK*
  
The sequence in the Q-branch is delayed by T/2, where T is channel symbol duration \(by 1 bit duration\). With this operation 180 degrees phase jumps are avoided and hence deep distortions in envelope will not occur.

OQPS and QPSK have the same theoretical BER performance. 

![BER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirlf/cubesats/master/.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

> *Fig. 3.3. Bit error ratio curves in Rician flat fading channel.*

Moreover, [pulse shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_shaping) procedure is frequently applied. 

> Pulse shaping motivation provided in [Root Raised Cosine Filters & Pulse Shaping in Communication Systems.](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120008631.pdf)

Comparison of the different waveforms in terms of spectral efficiency and BER performance is done in [\[2\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/904973/).

### Why was GMSK replaced in modern solutions?

GMSK was a good solution for the satellite communications \[3\] for a long time due to its promissing spectral parameters (see [the following figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-shift_keying#Properties)).

In other hand, MSK waveform can also be designed as OQPSK (i.e. in [I/Q manner](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306035050\_A\_Notebook\_on\_Wireless\_Communication\_Systems/figures)) with the sinusoidal pulse shaping \[5, 6\].

> **NOTE**:
> * Pulse Shaped OQPSK \(SOQPSK\) can be represented as continuous phase modulation \(CPM\) [\[4\]](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f025/2fa31444fad6a5090527d73f87352137c9b8.pdf).
> * Minimum shift keying \(MSK\) is the partial case of the Continuous Phase Frequency Shift keying \(CPFSK\) and therefore of the CPM.

Moreover, theoretically, the spectral parameters of the SOQPSK can be optimized as well as in GMSK case with a good selection of the filter for the pulse shaping.  

However, it should be taken into account that MSK \(GMSK\) is the [partial case of the 2-FSK](https://www.quora.com/How-many-bits-per-symbol-are-transmitted-in-MSK). OQPSK is the [quadrature modulation](http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/QPSK-vs-OQPSK-vs-pi-4QPSK.html) scheme and has the same throughput as QPSK or 4-QAM.

### Why are M-QAM schemes not presented above?

M-QAM was replaced by the M-APSK in space communication (fig. 3.5).

![apsk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirlf/cubesats/master/.gitbook/assets/APSK_advantages.png)

> *Fig. 3.5. The main advantages of APSK in comparison with QAM (prepared according to ["Standard + Customized APSK Schemes For Satellite Transmission" By Donald Vanderweit, Agilent Technologies, Inc.](http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=1051727556))*


## 3.3. Channel coding \(FEC\)

Very popular option of the FEC is [RSC \(Reed-Solomon convolutional\) concatenated codes](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Concatenated_codes#RS60). This relates to the [deep-space communication standartd](https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-63/63H.PDF) (see also [Reed–Solomon error correction: Space transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction#Space_transmission)).

However, since 2000-s modern error correction schemes such as [Turbo codes](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Turbo_code) and LDPC codes are used more widely in space communications \[10\].

Moreover the LDPC codes are the part of the DVB-S2/S2X standards (fig. 3.8)\[12\].

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirlf/cubesats/master/.gitbook/assets/dvb_new.PNG)

> Fig. 3.7. The block schemes of DVB-S and DVB-S2/SX2.
 
There are a lot of [comparison issues](https://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DC2-16_Ch7_LDPC.pdf) of the Turbo codes and LDPC in the literature \[7, p. 614, 653\]\, [\[10\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4383367/), \[11\].

Briefly, the main tradeoff can be formulated as following:
* Turbo codes are the mest choice for the lower code rate (e.g. 1/6, 1/3, 1/2);
* LDPC codes are appropriate solution for the higher code rates (e.g. 3/4, 5/6, 7/8).

Additionally, LDPC does not require interleaving and puncturing procedures.
