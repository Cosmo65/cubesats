## Modulation

### Why QPSK is preferable in comparison with BPSK?

### QPSK vs. OQPSK

### QPSK vs. MSK

| Modulation | QPSK | MSK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy gain |  |  |
| Spectral efficiency | 1 | 0.667 |

### MSK vs. GMSK

### Shaped OQPSK vs. conventional OQPSK

### Shaped OQPS vs. MSK/GMSK

## Channel coding \(FEC\)

As we can see from table 3.1 very popular option of the FEC is RSC \(Reed-Solomon convolutional\) concatenated codes. It relates to deep-space communication standartd \(fig. 3.1\) that allows to achieve sufficiently high BER performance \(fig. 3.2\).

Very interesting research can be found also in [\[3\]](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_262129.pdf)  where capabilities of Turbo convolutional , LDPC  and Polar codes are considered. 

Morover, according to[ \[4\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7095355/), in general,  Turbo codes have the similar computational complexity with RSC codes.
