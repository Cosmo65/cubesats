    "\n",
    "> * A MSK modulated signal has continuous phase in all cases, while a QPSK modulated signal has phase shifts of π or π/2. \n",
    "> * MSK signal does not have amplitude variations. \n",
    "> *  99% of MSK power is in main lobe. QPSK: 90%. \n",
    "> *  MSK modulated signals have lower side-lobes \\(- 23dB\\) than QPSK signals \\(–10 dB\\). Hence interchannel interference \\(ICI\\) is significantly larger in QPSK modulated signals. \n",
    "> * To avoid ICI, QPSK requires filtering, which can change the amplitude and phase of the QPSK waveform. Not required for MSK modulation. \n",
    "> * Distance between signal points is the same in QPSK and MSK. Probability of bit error in an additive white Gaussian noise channel \\(AWGN\\) is also the same.\n",

    "> * Null-to-Null RF transmission bandwidth of MSK is: Bnull = 1.5fb , which is 50% larger then the null-to-null bandwidth for QPSK, which is Bnull = fb . \n",

    "> * Generation and detection of a MSK modulated signal is slightly complex. \n",
    "> * Phase jitter may be present in MSK because of incorrect synchronization, which can degrade performance. \n",
    "> * Main lobe of MSK is wide. Unsuitable for applications where extremely narrow bandwidths and sharp cut-offs are required. \n",

    "\n",
    "> One of the methods for achieving this is the use of more bandwidth-efficient modulations, especially those best suited for use with nonlinear power amplifiers. Gaussian minimum shift keying \\(GMSK\\) is a popular waveform choice for bandwidth-constrained systems using nonlinear amplifiers. Since GMSK is a constant envelope modulation, nonlinear amplification does not produce spectral “regrowth” in the transmitted waveform. The instantaneous frequency is smoothed by a Gaussian low-pass filter to produce a signal with excellent spectral containment. The 3 dB bandwidth of the Gaussian low-pass smoothing filter can be adjusted to provide the system designer with a trade-off between detection efficiency and occupied bandwidth. GMSK has much better spectral containment than binary phase-shift keying \\(BPSK\\), quaternary phase-shift keying \\(QPSK\\), and offset QPSK which are used in the many of the current SATCOM systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "> This presentation briefly discusses application of the Root Raised Cosine \\(RRC\\) pulse shaping in the space telecommunication. Use of the RRC filtering \\(i.e., pulse shaping\\) is adopted in commercial communications, such as cellular technology, and used extensively. However, its use in space communication is still relatively new. This will possibly change as the crowding of the frequency spectrum used in the space communication becomes a problem. The two conflicting requirements in telecommunication are the demand for high data rates per channel \\(or user\\) and need for more channels, i.e., more users. Theoretically as the channel bandwidth is increased to provide higher data rates the number of channels allocated in a fixed spectrum must be reduced. Tackling these two conflicting requirements at the same time led to the development of the RRC filters. More channels with wider bandwidth might be tightly packed in the frequency spectrum achieving the desired goals. A link model with the RRC filters has been developed and simulated. Using 90% power Bandwidth \\(BW\\) measurement definition showed that the RRC filtering might improve spectrum efficiency by more than 75%. Furthermore using the matching RRC filters both in the transmitter and receiver provides the improved Bit Error Rate \\(BER\\) performance.\n",

    "> Turbo codes were the first of the modern iteratively decoded codes to become practical. LDPC codes followed and have proven very versatile, but they have not replaced turbo codes, or even the traditional block and convolutional codes. LDPC codes are decoded on a parity check matrix, and this matrix grows larger as the code rate is decreased, making low-rate LDPC decoders more complex. In contrast, turbo codes are decoded on trellises, with one trellis section per information bit, corresponding to several code symbols. Hence turbo codes remain superior to LDPC codes at low rates. Iterative decoding, of either turbo or LDPC codes, remains complex relative to either Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes or to algebraic decoding techniques for Reed–Solomon and other block codes. When decoding complexity is constrained, as it is in highdata- rate applications, the traditional codes remain unbeaten. It is unknown if there are fundamental reasons why these different niches require different coding solutions. It is quite possible that good LDPC codes based on generator matrices will be found, and that low complexity LDPC decoding algorithms will be discovered. If so, perhaps LDPC codes will eventually solve all coding problems.\n",
