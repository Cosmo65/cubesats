# Transmission bit rate

Theretical description of modulation scheme selection was provided by us in \[30\]. For **M-PSK** and **M-QAM** modulation schemes following formulas \[31 - 32\] can be used for estimation of **gross bit rate** :



where  is the **spectral effitiency** \(bits/seconds/Herz\)  is the modulation order and  is the **null-to-null bandwidth** \(Herz\)**,**  is the **3dB bandwidth** \(Herz\) ****and  is the **bit duration** \(seconds\)**.** Gross bit rate can be estimated throug the **baud rate \(symbol rate\)**   \(number of changes of modulation parameter\(-s\) per second\) also:

For **MSK** spectral efficiency is equal to \[33\]:

Therefore gross bit rate can be estimated via:

Note that symbol rate will depend on **channel bandwith** and therefore bit duration will be different for MSK and M-PSK \(and for diferent M-s\), i.e .
