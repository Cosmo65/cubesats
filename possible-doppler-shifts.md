# 4. Possible Doppler shifts

Possible doppler shifts can be estimated by well-known formula:


$$
f_D = f\frac{v}{c}cos\phi \qquad (4.1)
$$


where $$f $$ is the carrier frequency, $$c $$ is the speed of the electromagnetic wave, $$v $$ is the circular velosity of the satellite and $$\phi$$ is the elevation angle.

According to formula \(4.1\) and fig. 4.1 \(h = 750 km\)  possible doppler shifts can be also estimated.

As we see in the Figure 4.1 Doppler shifts for 2.4 GHz may be significant and therefore mitigation of the time selective fading techniques should be included in the final CubeSat configuration.
