    "According to [\\[1\\]](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b92b02053/printing/summer/Materials/channel%20model/CHN_A%20statistical%20model%20for%20land%20mobile%20satellite%20channels%20and%20itsapplication%20to%20nongeostationary.pdf) the most appropriate channel model for LEO satellites is the mixture of the Rician and lognormal independent fading processes with two ultimate conditions: light shadowing and strong shadowing \\(tab.1\\). Moreover, shadowing \\(lognormal part\\) is negligible on elevation angles larger than 60 degrees \\(and smaller than 120 degree\\) \\(fig. 3.1\\) [\\[1\\]](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b92b02053/printing/summer/Materials/channel%20model/CHN_A%20statistical%20model%20for%20land%20mobile%20satellite%20channels%20and%20itsapplication%20to%20nongeostationary.pdf).\n",

    " Before we start consideration of the modeling, character of the selectivity should be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is the channel frequency selective?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be frequecy flat the bandwith of the channel should not exceed coherence bandwith. In other words, symbol rate \\(baud rate\\) $R_S$  should be desirably selected according to the coherence bandwidth $B_c$ \\(and hence according to the root mean square \\(r.m.s.\\) delay spread $\\sigma \\tau_m$ \\) related restrictions \\[2\\]: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_s \\leq B_c \\approx \\frac{1}{10\\sigma \\tau_m} \\qquad (3.1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical $R_s$ for CubeSat systems [\\[3\\]](https://gomspace.com/Shop/subsystems/communication/nanocom-sr2000.aspx) lies between 0.5 and 2 MBd \\(S-band\\) and this fact also relates to the measured coherence bandwidth Bc = 0.5 – 2 MHz \\[4\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is the channel time selective?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be time flate the symbol \\(frame\\) period should not exceed coherence time.  Coherence time can be estimated by the maximum Doppler shift \\(according to Jakes model\\) as $T_c = \\frac{1}{f_{D,max}}$. \n",

    " Possible doppler shifts can be estimated by well-known formula:\n",

    "f_D = f_0\\frac{v}{c}cos\\phi \\qquad (3.2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    " where $f_0$  is the carrier frequency, $c$ is the speed of the electromagnetic wave, $v$ is the circular velosity of the satellite and $\\phi$ is the elevation angle.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Symbol duration $T_s$should be at least 10 times smaller to avoid time selectivity \\[2\\]. For LEO orbits \\(200-2000 km\\) symbol duration will be approximately $T_{s,max} = 1.6 \\mu s$ and therefore $R_{s,min} = 625$ kHz \\(since $R_s = 1/T_s$ in case of linear modulation schemes\\). That means that the channel is the time-flat in the range of $R_s$ from 625 kHz to 2 MHz.\n",

    "It makes scense to model Rician flat fading channel to estimate primaraly BER performance. Rician process  can be estimated based on described in [\\[5\\]](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0fdd/65ed5a4e90f2ee44a1a0a8caa3f7021ce9f9.pdf) common formula:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{H}$ is the channel matrix,  $K$ is the Rician factor, $\\mathbf{H_{LoS}}$ is the Line-of-Sight component and $\\mathbf{H_{NLoS}}$ is the Non-Line-of-Sight component \\(actually, is the Rayleigh fading process\\).\n",

    "Channel model with simplification to **SISO** case will have the following form:\n",
