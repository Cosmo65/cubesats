# Doppler Shifts

Possible doppler shifts can be estimated by well-known formula:

where  is the carrier frequency,  is the speed of the electromagnetic wave,  is the circular velosity of the satellite and  is the elevation angle.

According to formula \(4.1\) and fig. 4.1 \(h = 750 km\) possible doppler shifts can be also estimated.

Figure 4.1. Possible Doppler shifts in dependance of the elevation angle.

As we see in the Figure 4.1 Doppler shifts for 2.4 GHz may be significant and therefore mitigation of the time selective fading techniques should be included in the final CubeSat configuration.
